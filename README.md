# Movie Tracker

## Purpose

If you're like me, you most likely watch a lot of TV shows and movies across a variety of different platforms. This is an easy way to lose track of where you are in a show, or if you've seen a movie or not--especially if you drop the movie/show mid-way through to watch something else for a few months. This application aims to provide a solution to that problem in an easy, intuitive way with an elegant UI.

### Project Setup
-----------------

#### Tech Stack

The client side application will be built using React with either the context API or redux. Behind the scenes will be a REST API built using Express.js. Both of these applications will support typescript and testing with jest. Our server will interact with a postgres database for persistence using typeORM. Each of these services will be behind a nginx proxy and containerized with docker, docker-compose, and docker-machine. Tooling will utilize a linter (tslint) and prettier to auto format our code.
